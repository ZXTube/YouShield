# YouShield

Protecting you from YouTube

This extension tries as hard as possible to keep you from procrastinating and falling into the YouTube loop.
It has a very simplistic and calm design. So it deletes everything that's not needed.

It removes the YouTube homepage video recommendations and gives you two options, search, or consume.
The consume button sends you to the subscriptions page so that you can choose which quality channels to consume.
If you watch a video it deletes all the videos on the right.
If you open a shorts video you won't be able to scroll down to get more videos and get stuck in that disgusting trap.

Download this extension [on chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youshield/iohilpdcenclcjbjbebbjgpiimobkpje) or you can download it from GitHub by clicking the [releases button](https://github.com/ZXTube/YouShield/releases) downloading the CRX file, then you'll get a popup asking you if you want to download the extension. Or if that doesn't work, you can open the tab for managing extensions, then drag and drop the CRX file anywhere there.

Thanks, and enjoy *not* procrastinating

[**You Shield 1.0**](https://github.com/ZXTube/YouShield/releases/tag/1.0) is very different from YouShield 2.0 and 3.0 so some people might prefer it, check it out.

*If this extension was updated recently the updates could take up to a month to reflect in the chrome web store, if you want the new changes now you can download the extension from GitHub
