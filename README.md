Protecting you from YouTube

This extension tries as hard as possible to keep you from procrastinating and falling into the youtube content hole.

It removes the YouTube homepage video recommendations and replaces it with this:

If you're watching a video it deletes all the videos on the right and it lookes like this:

and if you try to watch any YouTube short, this will happen:

To download this extension, you just need to click the releases button at the right of the screen and download the crx file, then you'll get a popup that asking you if you want to download the extension. Or if that doesn't work, you can open the manage extensions tab and then drag and drop the crx file anywhere there.

Thanks, and enjoy *not* procrastinating
