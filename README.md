Protecting you from YouTube

This extension tries as hard as possible to keep you from procrastinating and falling into the youtube content hole.

It removes the YouTube homepage video recommendations and replaces them with this:

If you're watching a video it deletes all the videos on the right and it looks like this:

The shorts button and the notifications button are removed, and if you open a link to a shorts video you won't be able to scroll down to get more videos

You can download this extension [on chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youshield/iohilpdcenclcjbjbebbjgpiimobkpje) or you can download it from github by clicking the [releases button](https://github.com/ZXTube/YouShield/releases) at the right of the screen and download the CRX file, then you'll get a popup asking you if you want to download the extension. Or if that doesn't work, you can open the tab for managing extensions, then drag and drop the CRX file anywhere there.

Thanks, and enjoy *not* procrastinating

[**You Shield 1.0**](https://github.com/ZXTube/YouShield/releases/tag/1.0) is very different from YouShield 2.0 and 3.0 so some people might prefer it, check it out.
