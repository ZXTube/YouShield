# YouShield

Protecting you from yourself

This extension tries as hard as possible to keep you from procrastinating and falling into the youtube content hole.

To download this extension, you just need to click the releases on the right and download the YouShieldExtension.crx file, then you'll get a popup that will tell you to enable the extension. Or if that doesn't work, you can open the manage extensions tab and then drag and drop the crx file anywhere there.
